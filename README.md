This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.

# With Docker

This examples shows how to use Docker with Next.js based on the [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#docker-image). Additionally, it contains instructions for deploying to Google Cloud Run. However, you can use any container-based deployment host.

## Using Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
1. Build your container: `docker build . -t website_tournament --build-arg GITHUB_TOKEN=enter-token-here`.
1. Run your container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 website-tournament`.

You can view your images created with `docker images`.

### In existing projects

To add support for Docker to an existing project, just copy the `Dockerfile` into the root of the project and add the following to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... rest of the configuration.
  output: "standalone",
};
```

This will build the project as a standalone app inside the Docker image.
